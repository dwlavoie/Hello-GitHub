# Hello-GitHub
Introduction
My name is David William Lavoie. I am a graduate student Studying Chemical Engineering at the University of California: Davis, particularly in the field of optimal stochastic scheduling and control for energy intensive process units on networks of hybrid traditional and renewable energy generation. My skillset emphasizes a unique blend of experimental, computational, variational, and practical expertise with a wide variety of fields. 
I have gutted and rebuilt a house from frame to finish.
I have set-up and operated a number of supercritical fluid systems as a member of PHASEX and in the course of my research.
I have electrospun metallic nanowires and taken SEM images of the thin-films produced.
I have redesigned and implemented a new technique to generate blade worth curves in Nuclear Reactors.
I have created a back-end and front-end interface for a BWR outage dosage reduction & planning tool.
I am familiar with c++, C#, python, MATLAB, and AMPL. 
I am comfortable teaching thermodynamics, heat transfer, process design, mass transfer, and any mathematics up to (analytic) partial differential equations.
Currently, I am working on the following projects:
  1. Progressive Hedging for scheduling of non-isothermal, multiproduct CSTR in a TOU tariff environment
  2. Empirical Mode Decomposition of Acoustic Signals emitted during Coffee Roasting
  3. Variational Formulation of Multi-agent stochastic game Markets.
  4. Learning Object-Oriented Programming.
